# Gluon

Gluon is a firmware framework to build preconfigured OpenWrt images for public mesh networks.

## Gluon-Parker

This is a fork of Gluon, that uses routing between the nodes (aka. Router devices) and the infrastructure.
It is currently in use by [Freifunk Braunschweig](https://freiunk-bs.de).
Other communities are interested in adopting it as well.

Documentation is currently sparse.
Some hints can be found here:

* https://freifunk-bs.de/parker.html

Not all features needed for a parker-style Gluon are currently upstream - they are kept in this repository.
In this repository we will keep a branch for every upstream development branch with our local changes on top.
These branches follow the upstream naming, so `v2023.2.x-parker` will track `v2023.2.x`.
Releases will be tagged with an additional suffix: Tag `v2023.2.4.1-parker` will be on top of `v2023.2.4`.

We are planning to bring all these changes into upstream Gluon.
Feel free to help!

Other packages needed for a parker-style Gluon are developed in the [community-packages](https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/community-packages) repository.
They are named `ffbs-parker-*`.

A parker-style network needs a different backend.
You can get some inspiration from [here](https://gitli.stratum0.org/ffbs/ffbs-ansible).
